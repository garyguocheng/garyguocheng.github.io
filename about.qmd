I grew up in Wuhan, China, where I completed my high school. Then I went to London School of Economics and Political Science for undergrad and Columbia University for master's.

During the 4.5 years of studying economics, I took particular interests in microeconomic theory. I love to study the application of game theory, information design, and mechanism design in real-world frameworks.
